                    <p class="card-text">
                        Difference between two types of web storage such as local storage and session storage is given
                        bellow: <br>
                        <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Local storage keeps the data even if the session is over. Data
                        will be retained
                        if the data is not deleted manually. <br>
                        <strong>Session Storage:</strong> Session storage keeps the data only for the current session.
                        After the session
                        is over it will automatically delete the data.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Scope in javascript is simply the accessibility of variables, functions or objects. There are
                        two types of scope in javascript as follows: <br>
                        <strong>Block Scope: </strong> Variable declared in a curly braces {} is known as block scoped
                        and they can not be
                        accessed outside of this scope. Keywords such as let and const provide this type of scope. <br>
                        <strong>Global Scope:</strong> Variable declared inside or outside of the curly braces {} with
                        the keyword var is
                        globally scoped. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Javascript is a single threaded and synchronous language. The <strong>event loop</strong> is the
                        process where it is responsible for JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous programming. Because of this event
                        loop javascript can handle concurrent work. This event loop is a part of the javascript engine
                        which is actually responsible for this concurrency. The process of event loop constantly checks
                        if there is any event in the call stack queue, if there is any then it will be invoked.
